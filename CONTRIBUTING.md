## Development Workflow

- Install the dependecies using `npm`. This will also bootstrap a monorepo installing dependencies inside each package and linking them together.

- Build the libraries using `npm build` at the top level or inside single package.

## Versioning

This project uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to manage versions and publishing.

## Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the `master` branch. We don‚Äôt use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases.
